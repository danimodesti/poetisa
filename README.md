This repository contains all the work I have done as a research assistant in the field of Natural Language Processing at C4AI. It includes articles I have read, scripts I have developed, and other related materials. Learn more about the project on https://sites.google.com/icmc.usp.br/poetisa. 

The project I am involved with is called "Análise semântica para o português: a construção de um banco de proposições e aplicações computacionais" (in free translation: "Semantic Analysis for Portuguese: the construction of a Propbank and Computational Applications").

### September, 2024
- 09.01 --> Research start date.
- 09.12 --> I have read four chapters (1st, 6th, 8th and 9th) from the book ["Processamento de Linguagem Natural: Conceitos, Técnicas e Aplicações em Português"](https://brasileiraspln.com/livro-pln/2a-edicao/), studying introductory Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts and tasks.
- 09.19 --> First in-person meeting with POeTiSA group colleagues. Discussions and presentations about the group work so far (subprojects and future).
- 09.24 --> Online meeting to discuss the annotation of speech acts.
- 09.26 --> I have read articles about PropBank and Verbo-Brasil, and a book chapter about the task of Semantic Role Labeling (SRL).

### October, 2024
- 10.10 --> Explored Verbo-Brasil and Propbank.Br websites and their relation with the previous readings.
- 10.15 --> Online meeting to discuss the Semantic Annotation of tweets with the research group.
- 10.24 --> Studied the [CONLL-U format](https://universaldependencies.org/format.html), read the Porttinari-base PropBank  (PBP) article, and explored the new Verbo-Brasil website. Started developing a script to try correcting some improperly formatted accented words in the Verbo-Brasil files.

### November, 2024
- 11.14 --> Read the VerbLexPor article, continued developing the correction script.

### December, 2024
- 12.05 --> Finished a version of the script, which generates three logs containing filenames, original sentences, corrupted words, and suggested corrections, if any. Explored the semantic role annotation manual for Portuguese, attempted to log in to the new Verbo-Brasil web interface, and encountered problems.

### January and February, 2025
- ~ 30.01 --> Readings about Jubilee and Cornerstone tools and AMR-PT (text representation).
- Deeveloping a naive way to group sentences by args/roles.

### March, 2025
- Efforts on the semiannual report about the project progress.

### April, 2025
- Reading about BERT
- Trying to develop a second way of grouping sentences, using BERT.

### May and June, 2025
- Mostly trying to develop an interface capable of pre-process and pre-format the sentences, similarly to Cornestone's way.

### August, 2025
- Final efforts to improve AI usage in the project.
- 31.08 --> Officially ended the project development's period.

### September, 2025
- Efforts on the final report about the project, in order to finish the research process.
